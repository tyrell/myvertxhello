[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc login -u developer -p developer

$ oc new-project MY_PROJECT_NAME

$ mvn clean fabric8:deploy -Popenshift -DskipTests
----

== CI/CD Deployment
As part of the process of creating this booster, launch.openshift.io set up a project with a CI/CD deployment of this booster. You can see the status of this deployment in your Single-node OpenShift Cluster Web Console. You can also learn more about this booster and rest of the Eclipse Vert.x runtime in the link:http://appdev.openshift.io/docs/vertx-runtime.html[Eclipse Vert.x Runtime Guide].
